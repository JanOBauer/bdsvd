\title{Covariance matrix simulation for BD-SVD}
\usage{
bdsvd.cov.sim(p = p, b, design = design)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Number of variables.}

\item{b}{Number of blocks. Only required for simulation design "c" and "d".}

\item{design}{Simulation design "a", "b", "c", or "d".}
}
\value{
A covariance matrix according to the chosen simulation design.
}
\description{
This function generates covariance matrices based on the simulation studies described in Bauer (202Xa).
}
\examples{
#The covariance matrix for simulation design (a) is given by
Sigma <- bdsvd.cov.sim(p = 500, b = 500, design = "a")
